# Set up your development environment.

Like most programming languages, Terraform can be developed with any text editor.  That being said, we can enhance our experience with some freely available tools.  Here are the steps to set up a basic Terraform development environment:

1. Download an editor.  In this video we will use Microsoft Visual Studio Code which is free to use and supports all major operating systems.  It can be downloaded [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. [Download and install Hashicorp Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install).

That's all you need to get started, but we want some additional tools to enhance our experience and to be more productive.  There are many tools available, but we won't go into those yet.  In order to expedite the process of setup we're going to use devcontainers.

Devcontainers allow us to run a full development environment within a docker container.  Visual Studio Code fully supports devcontainers, however a working installation of Docker Desktop is required to enable the functionality.  Instructions for installing Docker can be found [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Once Visual Studio Code and Docker are installed we are ready to download the example code for this video.
