# Hello Terraform

When learning any new technology it's best to start with the simplest possible working example.  Terraform is no different.  In this example we'll see how to use the basic Terraform commands to ensure our environment is set up and working.

1. Open a command line terminal (This can be any shell such as bash, or Powershell but the devcontainer is pre-configured to use zshell).

3. Run `terraform apply -auto-approve`
